This Calculator app is my solution to all the terrible calculators out there on the app store. 

There are some amazing ones with great features, but they often get so feature packed or try to look so good that they 
end up sacraficing user experience.

A calculator should just be simple and easy to use, while also being aesthetically pleasing.

Maybe to some, a Calculator is not really that important; however, after the 4 years I spent getting my degree in Mathematics,
I must disagree, and say that a good calculator is definitely worth having.
